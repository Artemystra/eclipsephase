Disclaimer: All of this was build on the Boilerplate System of FoundryVTT which was distributed for mingeling around in it. Thanks Atropos for this! (https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding)

This system is an eclipse phase pen & paper system for the Foundry VTT software. It's build by a total newbie so do not expect much, but if I did not write it otherwise I'll maintain the code and try to improve it over time. Feel free to get your own clone to try to make it even better (if this is something I need to give you access right to just write me). 

If you want to use it for your own campaigns: Go for it! And please have fun.
