The first inofficial Eclipse Phase 2e system is about two years in the making and nears it's version 1.0 (A state in which the core rules are working with some convenience features where I see fit.). If you like my work and want to support me, please consider buying me a kofi (https://ko-fi.com/diemen) or just texting me here or on discord (jorra#7357) to say "thank you!". It means a lot to me!

<h2>For Players</h2>
<h3>Character Sheet Design</h3>
<p><img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/characterSheet2.png"><br>
<i>The character sheet is designed to reduce player search time</i></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The Persona Section<strong><br>
Holds every information that rarely changes during a session or even a campaign. It holds your aptitudes, traits & flaws and the personality description of your character as well as their goals, IDs and rep.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Inventory Section<strong><br>
A normal character has a lot of inventory to manage, such as armor, weapons, special gear and even vehicles or special abilities like psi sleights. While the skills tab is the most commonly used in this section, most of the other tabs are often just to help you setting your character up for a mission and then not to be seen again for some time. Yet it√üs still common to browse your different inventories while making up your mind how to overcome a threat.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Action Side Car<strong><br>
Here you find an overview of the most important items your character has currently at hand. It's meant to be a combat/scene companion that gives you qick access to the items currently at hand. The Side Car also provides a lot of other helpful information.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Action Side Car</h3>
<p>The basic idea of the Action Side Car is that you as a player sets up their characters inventory for a mission or scene and save navigation time afterwards, to prevent you from navigating to your (probably extensive) inventory again in search for this one item you want to use.</p>
Apart from this the Action Side Car comes with a number of convenience features that help you and your GM alike to understand the rules a bit better:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Modification Overview<strong><br>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/modifiers.png">
</div><br>
To provide you as a player with a better idea of the modifications automatically applied to your rolls, you have the Modification Over on top of the Side Car. You can always hover it to get more information about the nature of the modifications you're suffering.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Armor Section<strong><br>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/armorOverview.png">
</div><br>
Presents the player with a cumulated value for both their energy and their kinetic armor. Beside stating if the armor exceeding certain thresholds it's also hoverable so players can understand the armor values and how any modification may impact them a bit better.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Item Details<strong><br>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/itemDetails.png">
</div><br>
While it's necessary to reduce the provided information, about any item shown, to the bare minimum in order to save as much space as possible, players can easily decollapse these items to get to know more about their items at hand.
</li>
<strong>Reload Automation<strong><br>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/reload.png">
</div><br>
Melee and Ranged weapons can be directly rolled from this section. If applicable, ranged weapons automatically deduct the ammo used from the sheet. The Action Side Bar provides players with the option to reload them directly. This mechanic is not yet bound to any ammunition. This will eventually change before deployment of v1.0.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contextual Dice Roll Menus</h3>
<p>Most of the rules in Eclipse Phase a relatively straight forward, which is reflected in the minimal design of the common dice roll pop-up. To save you, as a player, time and nerves special rolls like attacks, fray or psi are enriched to provide the best UX as possible, while navigating through your GMs challenges.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/diceRollMenu.png">
</div><br>
<i>Hacking is not yet fully implemented. This might change after the deployment of v1.0 as result of the rules complexity around this topic.</i>

<h3>Rules & Tooltips</h3>
<p>Where applicable the system is enriched with other tooltips including some of the more complex rules of Eclipse Phase, to save you time searching for them in the rulebook. If you're missing some important rules feel free to open an issue and let's discuss this matter.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/Tooltips.png">
</div><br>

<h3>Automatic Rest Calculator</h3>
<p>Resting allows players to recover pool points. All you have to do is choosing your preferred rest type by clicking the checkbox next to it. The roll will happen automatically and refills your pools to the max if possible. If not it's presenting you with another menu to choose how to distribute your points.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">

</div><br>

<h2>For GMs</h2>
<h3>NPC & Threat Sheet Design</h3>
<p><h2>NPC Sheet</h2>
<img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/npcSheet.jpg"></p>
<p><h2>Threat Sheet</h2>
<img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/threatSheet.jpg">
<i>The main difference between the Threat and the NPC sheet is the fact, that NPCs are provided with goals and extended psi rules, as they're meant to be closer to what a player character is about to experience during a mission or campaign.</i></p>
While player character sheets are quite complex, they're designed to be used in a more exclusive way, screen estate wise. While your players will commonly have only one character open, you might casually view multiple threat & NPC sheets all at once. Therefore the screens are reduced much more, without preventing you from using any other functionality.

<h3>Enriched Dice Results</h3>
<p>While the rules of EP are relatively straight forward, keeping track of all the modifiers affecting your players rolls can be tedious. This is why the system tries to make dice roll results as tranparent as possible.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/diceResults.png">
</div><br>

<h3>Extensive Compendium Packs</h3>
<p>Since Eclipse Phase is published under a creative commons license it's possible for us to provide you with many of the standard items, available from the EP2E base rules.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">
    <img src="https://war-klar.de/PicShare/GitHub/Compendiums.png">
</div><br>

<h3>Automated Chat Feedback</h3>
<p>While TTRPG is all about trust and communication, there are sometimes things players forget to communicate while still important that you're keeping track of them. For this reason the system provides you with many automated chat messages, briefing you about what your players are about and how they're trying to achieve it.</p>
<div style="display: grid; align-items: center;">

</div><br>

<h3>Active Effects</h3>
Active Effects is a built in Foundry feature which works with this system. It helps players and game masters to add temporary effects which may be switched on and off based on several indicators like <strong>presence of an item</strong>, <strong>real life time</strong> or <strong>the items status (active inactive)</strong>. <p>

Since there are several items (like traits, flaws and ware) that are morph specific we also included the automatic activation/deactivation of those items when the morph is switched, so you will never have to keep track of any situational modifiers you might only have during populating a specific morph. (<strong>Important:</strong> this only goes for any items which are <strong>always</strong> providing bonuses. Items that only provide bonuses in specific situations like "to all perceive tests <strong>if smell is included</strong>" do not work yet.)<p>

Creating your own active effect items is simpel, but as for now you need to now the exact data value path. To make this a bit easier for you we created a list with all modifiers that are present till date, so you don't have to guess on how to build your own active effect items.

<h2><strong>Disclaimers</strong></h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>Please keep in mind, that this system is build from ground up using a boilerplate and coded by one person who is totally new to coding in general. While I had some great help in the past (looking at you, Will) most of the code is done by myself and not very coherent nor well documented (though I'm trying my best). If not otherwise noted, this system will keep updating constantly, but please feel free to reach out with your own ideas if you like. I really hope that you like the system and that you're going to enjoy many meaningful hours of fun with your friends & players all around the world!</p>
