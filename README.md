All of this was build on the Boilerplate System of FoundryVTT which was distributed for mingling around in it. Thanks, Atropos for this! (https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding)

It's build by a total newbie so do not expect much, but if I did not write it otherwise I'll maintain the code and try to improve it over time. Feel free to get your own fork (hue hue hue) to try to make it even better.

If you want to use it for your own campaigns: Go for it! Please have fun.</h5>

The following features are included

<ul>
<li>3 different Character types (Actors, NPCs and Threats)</li>
<li>Derived stats (Ini, trauma, durability etc.)</li>
<li>Better readable chat messages (with success/failure warnings)</li>
<li>Drag & droppable (morph)traits, armor, ware, weapons & vehicles</li>
<li>Simple system to show which items are carried "at hand"</li>
<li>Initiative Tracker + Ini Modifier (on all sheets)</li>
<li>Roll modification dialogs for all skills. Special dialogs for:</li>
<ul>
<li>Fray Checks</li>
<li>Gun & Melee Checks</li>
<li>Damage Rolls</li>
</ul>
<li>Multiple body support for PCs for up to 6 morphs</li>
<li>Ever growing convenience Tooltips to make you play more an search for rules less</li>
</ul>

I'm trying to improve this system on a steady basis, but it will remain a hobby project. If you have any suggestions feel free to open Issues on GIT Hub - I'll come back to you as soon as possible.

I'm also happy for any support - either by saying "thanks" or buying me a kofi: https://ko-fi.com/diemen
