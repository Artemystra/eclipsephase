All of this was build on the Boilerplate System of FoundryVTT which was distributed for mingling around in it. Thanks, Atropos for this! (https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding)

It's build by a total newbie so do not expect much, but if I did not write it otherwise I'll maintain the code and try to improve it over time. Feel free to get your own fork (hue hue hue) to try to make it even better.

If you want to use it for your own campaigns: Go for it! Please have fun.
